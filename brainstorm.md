## 🧠 Step 1: New App Ideas

### 1. **Nostalgia-fy**
A calendar-based music and photo experience. Lets users look back on a specific calendar date and:
- See what music they were listening to on Spotify that day
- View a montage of photos they took on that same calendar date (any year)

### 2. **Habit Garden**
A gamified habit tracker where each good habit waters a plant. Miss a habit and the plant withers.

### 3. **FlashFuel**
A flashcard app powered by AI that quizzes you based on your weak points, spaced repetition, and past performance.

### 4. **Friendr**
See when your friends are free based on their shared calendars (privacy-aware). Tap to suggest a hangout.

### 5. **SoundSnap**
An app that records short voice memories (10–30s) and maps them on a location-based timeline.

### 6. **QuickChef**
Snap a photo of your fridge ingredients and get fast recipe ideas. Filters for dietary needs and cook time.
